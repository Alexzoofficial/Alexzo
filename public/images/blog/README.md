## Note:
Only these 3 images are actually referenced in blog-data.ts. All other images were unused and have been removed to optimize the codebase.

The images were accidentally deleted but need to be restored. Since they are not in git history, they need to be:
- Re-uploaded by the user, OR
- Regenerated using AI image generation tools, OR  
- Replaced with appropriate stock images

For now, placeholders can be used until the actual images are restored.
